== Migrated SeaBSD stuff ==

This repo contains some stuff which lives in the Seasteading Bahamas Denizens
crypto-panarchist society. Our own panarchy contract runs on Tari/XMR and is
written in Rust therefore. Due to bridging purposes we are writting a version
of it in Solidity which will also be used to hook into a web3js frontend as an
experiment. Reason is to have a web3 version of Aurora wallet and allow for
easier usage within the islands.

A second reason is SmartBCH which may be hooked to our Tari environment as well
