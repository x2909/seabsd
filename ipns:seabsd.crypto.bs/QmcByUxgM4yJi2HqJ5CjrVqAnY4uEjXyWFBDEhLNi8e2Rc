<p id="disclaimer">  Seasteading Bahamas Denizens (seabsd) is a community of sailors and boaters around the 
world who frequently meet and live (hence, denizens) in the Caribbean region of Bahamas. This community is 
built around the values of crypto-panarchism and we’ve built a living trust chain of boaters mutually 
respecting, serving and supporting ourselves as individuals, families and society. </p>

<p>We started the community counting 8 boats and 26 people on late 2013, and now, in 2021, we are 163 boats, 
mostly multihull, and 182 families almost reaching the so called Aristotelian “ideal” size for a 
community to fully develop it’s abilities and deploy division and specialization of labor. Today we are 
able to provide liberal basic education (trivium & quadrivium) to toddlers, children and teens; we are able 
to provide applied mathematics, advanced logic, cryptography and computer programming classes to adults 
preparing to enter the market; we are also able to teach economics, from family and personal finance to 
macro economy. We are able to provide health services, medicine (including some medicines produced within 
the community) and fundamental health aid. As seasteaders, we are mostly an exterritorial covenant 
community, depending on territorial members only to exchange and trade farmed goods - including red meat for 
the ones of us who can’t live eating only fishing meat. And yes, we have the booze and the beer. Finally 
and most important, we own a small marina in Bimini and two shipyards in the keys, used for sailboat 
maintenance and repairs (minor to complex) on cats and multihulls made of duralumin, wood and composite.</p>

<p>Our society is founded entirely on values of private property and exchange. Bootstrapping from cypher and 
crypto-panarchism, we share primary values of non aggression [or micro-aggression] towards one’s body and 
mind (maximizing body and psique integrity), deriving liberty, property of production and exchange as the 
whole set of ethical values not to initiate aggression against. Conflicting interests are rare, but upon 
rising, disputes are privately arbitrated. We prefer TRB private dispute resolution scheme. We derive 
justice from ethics and ethics from laws. We are mostly stateless, exterritorial. A trust ring of private 
invitation only [sailboat] owners. A friendly, happy and peaceful voluntary private society opting-out (or 
stealthily avoiding) coercive government.</p>

<p>We strongly support and wish best success to the Seasteading Institude, Ocean Builders and other similar 
entrepreneurship human agency researching and building engineering tech to allow future means to 
seasteading. We support (how could we not) the DEFCON’s Hack The Sea Village.</p>

<p>Stealthy existence means we maximize privacy and identity confidentiality. Crypto-panarchists means we 
maximize cryptography and cyphertext communication within social and economics engagement. Real names are 
only listed in the intranet for members who want it. Screen names and nicknames are preferred. Private notes 
for people and business are encrypted by individual private keys. Always remember to ask permission before 
taking pictures. </p>

<p>We prefer PQCrypto. Abuse it!</p>

<p>We support Crypto-Cat and will horn on honoring of every boat traded with crypto. We prefer 
cryptocurrency trades , XMR and BTC primarily. We have our own BSD stablecoin, exchanged at the rate of 
~0.95 BSD or Sand Dollar (Bahamian Dollar in traditional fiat and CBDC forms) which is always exchangeable 
into XMR. It means we use and accept BSD for trades outside our community.</p>

<p>This information is publicly available as a disclaimer of values ahead of intersocial voluntary 
engagements.</p>

boaters. Donations in BTC can be sent to <code>1B1AZ7cjhmTcdjE6Xq4um3dCLode1RrfTJ</code> and donations in

<h1>FAQ (Frequently Asked Questions)</h1>
<p>This is the frequently asked questions we've been asked in person or via e-mail, it's useful for 
contractor, friends and people who want to fork such a community.</p>

<h3 id="faq1">a) How can I join the community?</h3>
<p> You can’t. We are an invitation-only community, if you are a friend and party of trade, you probably 
know some of us and you might be invited in the future. Invitation is discussed internally and as a 
trust-chain, a couple participants need to trust you in advance, before you are introduced to everyone else.

<h3 id="faq2">b) How can I start my own seasteading crypto-panarchist community?</h3>
<p><i>Write the code. Code your community.</i> Decide upon smart contract formats. Discuss the signature 
format. Assert the communication patterns. Make sure you have real value to offer to each other as a group, 
as a family, to further become a hardened social community. Make sure the key participants are comfortable 
with choosen media and tech. Make sure every initial participants share the same values - stress it out. 

<p>Make sure you are comfortable with the crypto-panarchist manifesto and values. Decide which explicit 
terms are likely to be the minimal norms everyone should follow. Don’t go beyond the minimum! Code the 
smart contract. Consider coding an escrow smart contract with non-leverageable deposit guarantees for higher 
value economic business engagement. Pick your social platform for online engagements (we use HumHub with 
custom IPFS, trust-chain and smart-contracts modules).

<p>Finally, the biggest challenge: avoid going illegal; choose a country with loose regulations and great 
freedom. While today's state of naval engineering does not allow for full time living in international 
waters, you will often need land support. This is why we are settle in Caribbean: great people, great food, 
great liberty, little and loose regulations, private property and private law friendly waters. We have 
friends living in exterritorial crypto-panarchist communities onshore in Central America and Mexican 
Caribbean as well as Italian autonomous regions. Follow professor Tom W. Bell’s insights on special 
economic zones. Become stateless! Terminate your tax payment obligations in your country of origim and seek 
for countries you won’t become a global taxpayer. Avoiding long-term living in the same country is easier 
for seasteaders who are often visitors worldwide and unnecessary if seasteading on friendly waters, but it 
might be an additional challenge for onshore communities.

<p>Your community will be as great as the people who gather. Don’t rush growing it. Grow it healthy. Build 
a trust chain before you build a community. Finally, decide upon private dispute resolution schemes (we’ve 
chosen Udine TRB) and preferred currencies.

<h3 id="faq3">c) How can I learn more about crypto-panarchy?</h3>

<p>Learn about crypto-anarchism and cypherpunks first. There are books, Wikipedia entries, Tim May’s 
cyphernomicon FAQ, things we won’t link here not to be logged in someone else’s user-agents referral. 
But you can find it yourself. Next, learn about de Puydt’s Panarchy. Read the book <i>“Panarchy: 
Political Theories of Non-Territorial States”</i>. Check Tim May and 0xff4’s discussions upon 
polycentric laws. After or while that, you will be able to find The Crypto-Panarchist Manifesto and The 
Crypto-Panarchist book on the distributed net, on Web 3.0, TOR network and maybe at the surface.

<h3 id="faq4">d) How can I help or support your initiative?</h3>

<p>Other than <a href="#donation">donating</a>? If you can, please pin us! So we can be permanently 
available in more distributed nodes at the distributed IPFS web. Pinning us is as simple as <code>ipfs pin 
add -r /ipns/seabsd.crypto.bs</code> ! We thank you in advance for hosting a copy of our public website. 
Still want to help? Help yourself, your family and friends: if you can pin us, you can do IPFS, so please 
teach everyone you can about it! And about distributed finances, crypto, remailers, privacy, applied crypto, 
DNS, Web 3.0, blockchain smart contracts, Linux, BSD, digital money, digital ledgers, DAOs, cryptoconomy, 
distributed nets, <i>open source</i> sw, read and tell your network to read Voshmgir's <i>"Token 
Economy"</i> book. Take Richard Feynman's and Conway's advices for life. Teach twice what you've learned. 
Learn twice what you are teaching. Write code. Write equations. Hack all the things. Reject initiation of 
violence. These will be of great help!
